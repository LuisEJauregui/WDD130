    <h2>Luis Jauregui</h2>
    <p>My name is Luis Efrain Jauregui Ramirez, really close friends call me "Huarachudo".</p>
    <p> Im looking to complete the BA in Applied Technology. </p>
    <p>I love playing sports, specially basketball, I love camping and outdoor activities.</p>
    <p>I am married to Rocio Carrasco and together we have 3 children.
    <p>Paula our oldest daughter, Karen the middle girl and Enoc, our youngest son, </p>
    <p>and they are 10, 6 and 3 years old in that order.</p>
    <p>What I love most about BYUI is the fact that we are able</p>
    <p>to study basically from anywhere in the world in a school from the church.<p>
    <p>The reason I am studying is so that I am able to work remotely</p>
    <p>and better provide for my family.</p> 
    <p>I have been a Member of the Church all my life, and one of my favorite stories</p> 
    <p>from the scriptures is Lehi's vision of the Tree of Life</p>
